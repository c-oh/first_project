#My First Project

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/ZaRyEKX.jpg)

Being one of my first projects in the realm of web development, this project is constantly under going changes as I continually find new ways to improve the UI of the site and to upgrade the functionality of the site.

#Features:
As of date, the site is responsive as it adapts to mobile, tablet and desktop sizes, it features an automated fast-scrolling effect and it also has an image carousel.

#Languages used:
For this project, I used HTML5, CSS3/Sass and JQuery.
